            <p class="container">
                In database management systems (DBMS), the "ACID" properties are a set of four properties that ensure
                reliability and consistency in database transactions.

            <h4>Atomicity</h4>
            <p>
                This property ensures that a transaction is treated as a single unit of work, which means either all of
                its operations are successfully completed, or none of them are. If any part of the transaction fails,
                the entire transaction is rolled back to its original state, ensuring data integrity.
            </p>

    <section>
        <div class="ddlcmd container">
            <h4>Consistency</h4>
            <p>
                This property ensures that the database remains in a consistent state before and after the transaction.
                It means that the transaction must follow all the rules and constraints defined in the database schema,
                ensuring that data is always valid and conforms to predefined rules.
            </p>

    <section>
        <div class="ddlcmd container">
            <h4>Isolation</h4>
            <p>
                Isolation ensures that the execution of transactions concurrently doesn't cause them to interfere with
                each other. Each transaction appears to execute in isolation from other transactions, even though they
                may be executing concurrently. Isolation prevents issues such as dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and
                phantom reads.

    <section>
        <div class="ddlcmd container">
            <h4>Durability</h4>
            <p>
                Durability ensures that once a transaction is committed, its effects are permanent, even in the event of
                a system failure such as a power outage or crash. The changes made by the committed transaction are
                stored permanently in the database and are not lost, ensuring data persistence.

            <p>
                These ACID properties together ensure the reliability and consistency of data in a database, even in the
                presence of failures or concurrent transactions. They are fundamental for ensuring data integrity and
                are a cornerstone of transaction processing in modern database systems.

                <summary>1.What is the Atomicity property in DBMS? </summary>
                <p>
                    Atomicity ensures that either all operations of a transaction are completed successfully, or none of
                    them
                    are. It's like an "all or nothing" principle for transactions.
                </p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>2.What does Consistency mean in DBMS? </summary>
                <p>
                    Consistency ensures that the database remains in a valid state before and after the transaction. All
                    data must adhere to the predefined rules and constraints of the database schema.
                </p>

            <details>
                <summary>3.What is Isolation in the context of DBMS?</summary>
                <p>
                    Isolation ensures that the execution of multiple transactions concurrently doesn't interfere with
                    each other. Each transaction appears to execute independently, preventing issues like dirty reads or
                    non-repeatable reads.
                </p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>4.What does Durability mean in DBMS?</summary>
                <p>
                    Durability ensures that once a transaction is committed, its effects are permanent and will not be
                    lost, even in the event of a system failure. It guarantees that the changes made by committed
                    transactions are stored permanently in the database. </p>
